# Caspar Emanuel Fritzen

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Caspar, a multifaceted Software Engineer with a profound background in Technology and Management from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My journey in tech began with a BSc and MSc at TUM, where I dived deep into computer science and energy markets business specialization, culminating in a master's thesis that developed a full-stack web analytics platform for an ecolabel in collaboration with Germany's largest insurer, achieving the highest possible grade.

Before my academic and professional journey led me to the intersection of technology and management, I served as a Mountaineer in the Bundeswehr, fostering discipline and resilience. Transitioning into the tech world, my projects ranged from web development internships in Hong Kong and Austria to significant roles in startups and established companies alike. I've contributed to the development of a next-gen substrate-based DEX at TIDEFI, and currently, I'm refining and expanding the web analytics platform as a freelance Software Engineer at Friedl & Company, a TUM spinoff.

My technical toolkit is broad and versatile, encompassing Python, Django, R, Docker, SQL, Java, PHP, Laravel, JS, NodeJS, NextJS, GraphQL, AWS, GCP, and Git, to name a few. These skills have powered projects from web-based accounting systems to sophisticated cloud architecture and blockchain innovations.

Beyond coding, my passions include leveraging technology for sustainable energy solutions, exploring the latest in machine learning and blockchain, and engaging in outdoor activities like mountaineering and mountain biking. I am fluent in German and English, with foundational knowledge in Latin, French, and Italian.

This portfolio, built with **Next.js** and [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), is a testament to my professional journey and personal philosophy of continuous learning and innovation. Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me.
