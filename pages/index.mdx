### Current Main Activity

## Maintenance Automation Engineering Intern at Tesla Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, Paint Shop

As a Maintenance Automation Engineering Intern at Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, I focus on enhancing operational efficiency and system reliability within the Paint Shop. My key achievements include:

- **CMMS Integration:** Integrated thousands of mechanical spare parts into Tesla's in-house CMMS using Python, reducing update periods from weeks to days.
- **Automation Processes:** Developed automation processes for efficient cataloging and bulk uploading of spare parts, improving inventory management.
- **Maintenance Orders:** Automated maintenance orders for body carriers, optimized asset structures, and refined cycle count mechanisms.
- **AI-Driven Translations:** Pioneered multi-AI-agent translations of procedural guides, aiding maintenance teams across English and German.
- **PLC Integration:** About to streamline maintenance planning activities by integrating PLC alarm messages and codes, enhancing system reliability.

I collaborate with IT, automation, and engineering teams to improve system functionalities, conduct software QA, create user guides, and assist in developing strategies to reduce equipment downtime. My goal is to maximally contribute to accelerating the advent of sustainable energy.

### About Me

Welcome to my portfolio! 
I'm Caspar, a multifaceted Software & BizDev Engineer at the intersection of Technology and Management. My journey in tech began with a BSc and MSc at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I engulfed myself deep into computer science and energy markets, culminating in a master's thesis that developed a full-stack web analytics platform for an ecolabel in collaboration with Germany's largest insurer, achieving the highest possible grade.

Before my academic and professional journey led me to the intersection of technology and management, I served as a Mountaineer in the Bundeswehr, fostering discipline and resilience. Transitioning into the tech world, my projects ranged from web development internships in Hong Kong and Austria to roles in startups and established companies alike. I've contributed to the development of a next-gen substrate-based DEX at TIDEFI, and currently, I'm refining and expanding the web analytics platform, that I have built for my master thesis project, as a freelance Software Engineer at Friedl & Company, a TUM spinoff.

My technical toolkit is broad and versatile, encompassing Python, Django, R, Docker, SQL, Java, PHP, Laravel, JS, NodeJS (yes, I've built a comprehensive NodeJS Discord bot that I'm incredibly proud of), JS, TS, NextJS, GraphQL, AWS, GCP, and Git, to name a few. These skills have powered projects from web-based accounting systems to sophisticated cloud architecture and blockchain innovations.

Beyond coding, my passions include leveraging technology for sustainable energy solutions, exploring the latest in machine learning and blockchain, and engaging in outdoor activities like mountaineering and mountain biking. I am fluent in German and English, with foundational knowledge in French and Italian.

This portfolio, built with **Next.js** and [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), is a testament to my professional journey and personal philosophy of continuous learning and innovation. Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me.
